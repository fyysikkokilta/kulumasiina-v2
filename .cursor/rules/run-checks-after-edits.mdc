# Run Checks After Edits

After making any code changes, always run type checking and linting to ensure code quality.

## Required Commands

Run these commands in sequence after editing code:

```bash
# 1. Type checking
pnpm type:check

# 2. Linting (with autofix)
pnpm lint --fix

# 3. Format (or format:check when only verifying)
pnpm format
```

## When to Run

- ✅ After editing any TypeScript/JavaScript files
- ✅ After creating new components
- ✅ After refactoring code
- ✅ After fixing bugs
- ✅ Before completing a task

## Expected Behavior

1. **Type checking passes**: No TypeScript errors
2. **Linting passes**: All lint rules satisfied (or only warnings remain)
3. **Fix issues**: If errors occur, fix them before proceeding

## Example Workflow

```bash
# Make code changes...
# Then verify:

pnpm type:check
# ✓ No errors

pnpm lint --fix
# ✓ Fixed issues automatically

pnpm format
# ✓ Formatted files
```

## Don't Skip

Never skip these checks. They catch errors early and maintain code quality across the project.
