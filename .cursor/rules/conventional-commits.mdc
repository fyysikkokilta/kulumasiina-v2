# Conventional Commits

All commit messages must follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

## Types

- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **style**: Changes that don't affect code meaning (white-space, formatting)
- **refactor**: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **perf**: Performance improvement
- **test**: Adding or updating tests
- **build**: Changes to build system or dependencies
- **ci**: Changes to CI configuration
- **chore**: Other changes that don't modify src or test files

## Examples

### Good Commit Messages

```bash
# Simple feature
feat: add user authentication

# Feature with scope
feat(auth): implement OAuth2 login flow

# Bug fix with body
fix: resolve navigation crash on mobile

Users reported app crashes when navigating between screens.
Fixed by adding null checks before accessing navigation state.

# Breaking change
feat!: redesign API response format

BREAKING CHANGE: All API responses now use snake_case instead of camelCase
```

### Bad Commit Messages

```bash
# ❌ No type
"added new feature"

# ❌ Capitalized description
feat: Add user authentication

# ❌ Period at end
feat: add user authentication.

# ❌ Vague description  
fix: fix bug

# ❌ Too detailed in subject
feat: add user authentication with email, password, and OAuth support including Google and GitHub
```

## Rules

1. **Type is required**: Must start with a valid type
2. **Lowercase description**: Description must be lowercase
3. **No period**: Don't end description with a period
4. **Imperative mood**: Use "add" not "added" or "adds"
5. **Concise subject**: Keep subject line under 72 characters
6. **Scope optional**: Use scope in parentheses when it adds clarity
7. **Breaking changes**: Use `!` after type or `BREAKING CHANGE:` in footer

## When Creating Commits

Always format commit messages using this structure. If creating multiple commits, ensure each follows the convention independently.
